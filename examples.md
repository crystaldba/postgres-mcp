## Overview

Here are a few examples of of using [Postgres MCP Pro](https://github.com/crystaldba/postgres-mcp) by [crystaldba.ai](crystaldba.ai) to build, test, and scale your application.  It works in any MCP client such as... **(TODO)**

## Examples

### Movie Critic App

Let's do a quick AI-coding session and take an idea from concept to launch!

OK. Let's build the best movie ratings community/app. We'll use the [IMDB dataset](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/) to seed our database.

#### Stage 1: replit-induced joy

On [replit.com](https://replit.com/) we enter...
> Create a web app based on flask, python and SQAlchemy ORM
> It's website that uses the schema from the public IMDB dataset (https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/Â ). Assume I've imported the IMDB dataset as-is and add to that. I want people to be able to browse a mobile-friendly page for each movie, with all the IMDB data related to that movie. Additionally, people can rate each movie 1-5 and view top rated movies. The community and these ratings are one of the primary uses cases for the website.

**Boom!** We have a fully functionaly website with ratings, search, browse, auth -- in under 30 minutes.  What!  Am I officially a vibe-coder now?

This is amazing.  But it's sooooo goddamn slow!

#### Stage 2: go 0->1...person

I hear a lot about going 0->1, but not sure they meant 1 person.  Let's get the app ready for launch. 

We'll switch to Cursor and install [Postgres MCP Pro](https://github.com/crystaldba/postgres-mcp)
